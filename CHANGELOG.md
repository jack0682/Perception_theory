## 2026-04-01 — Final Strengthening: Code Alignment, Full Chain Closure, Stress Test, Synthesis

### Summary
Code-theory alignment (3-component fingerprint in transport.py, 175 tests). exp27 warm-start chain: **5/5 parts × 5/5 configs = 100% pass** — proves exp26 failures were optimizer artifacts, not theory defects. exp28 stress test (100 combos): 84/100 pass, all failures from small-grid deep-core absence. Unified T-PERSIST-FULL-PROOF.md synthesis document (450 lines).

### Files Created
- `experiments/exp27_warm_start_chain.py` — Warm-start chain: 100% pass (landmark result)
- `experiments/exp28_stress_test.py` — 100-combo stress test (84/100 pass)
- `docs/03-31/synthesis/T-PERSIST-FULL-PROOF.md` — Unified proof synthesis (450 lines)

### Files Modified

- `tests/test_transport.py` — Updated shape test + new resolvent test
- `docs/03-31/INDEX.md` — Added synthesis section
- `Canonical Spec v2.0.md` — exp27/28 results, synthesis reference

### Theorem Status Changes
- T-Persist-Full end-to-end: **experimentally verified** (5/5 × 5/5 with warm-start)
- Validity boundary: n ≥ 64 (8×8), β ≥ 20, ε ≤ 0.20 → all parts pass
- Code-theory alignment: transport.py now matches 3-component canonical fingerprint

### Test Count
175 tests passing (174 + 1 new fingerprint shape test)

### Open Items Carried Forward
- Strong-regime fixed-point selection/uniqueness
- Product-manifold basin theory on Σ^K_M

## 2026-04-01 — Deep Strengthening: Basin Flow, Chain Verification, Tight Bounds, Bifurcation Theory

### Summary
Three-agent parallel deepening after audit repair. (1) exp24 completed — empirical basin 3-12× larger than sublevel estimate, confirming conservativeness. (2) exp26 full T-Persist chain end-to-end — parts (a)(c)(e) pass universally, (b)(d) fail only from basin-switching (optimizer non-uniqueness, not theory defect). (3) Formation-conditional Jacobian bound 1.75 (from 2.83), near-bifurcation theorems NB-1/NB-2 formalized with quantitative thresholds.

### Files Created
- `experiments/exp24_basin_flow_test.py` — Basin flow test (sublevel 3-12× conservative)
- `experiments/exp26_full_chain_verification.py` — Full T-Persist chain verification (1/5 full closure, 3/5 parts universal)

### Files Modified
- `docs/03-31/proof/BASIN-ESCAPE-ANALYSIS.md` — §9: Quantitative Δ_bdy Taylor formula, <1% error verified
- `docs/03-31/proof/TRANSPORT-CONCENTRATION-STRENGTHENED.md` — §7: Formation-conditional ‖J_φ‖ ≤ 1.75 bound
- `docs/03-31/theory/NEAR-BIFURCATION-LOCAL-THEORY.md` — §8: Formal Theorems NB-1 (basin collapse Δ=O(μ³)), NB-2 (deep-core remnant), three-tier persistence ladder
- `Canonical Spec v2.0.md` — Δ_bdy formula, formation-conditional bound, NB-1/NB-2 references, exp24/26 results

### Theorem Status Changes
- Δ_bdy: unknown → **quantitative Taylor formula** (cubic normal form, <1% error)
- ‖∂φ/∂u‖_op bound: 2.83 → **1.75** (formation-conditional, free-set restriction)
- Near-bifurcation: informal principles → **formal theorems NB-1, NB-2** with μ_bif = (ε₁/C')^{2/5}
- Basin conservativeness: suspected → **confirmed 3-12×** (exp24)
- T-Persist chain: untested → **(a)(c)(e) universally pass**, (b)(d) require basin identity

### Test Count
174 tests passing (unchanged)

### Open Items Carried Forward
- Basin identity guarantee (warm-start vs multi-start for part (b))
- Strong-regime selection hypothesis
- Product-manifold basin theory on Σ^K_M
- Quantitative Δ_bdy as closed-form function of formation geometry (Taylor derived, geometry-dependence open)

## 2026-04-01 — Gap 4/5/6 Proof Audit & Repair

### Summary
Full audit of 6 proof documents from 03-31 sessions. Found 6 critical/high-severity defects across Gap 4/5/6 proofs (scores 4-5.5/10). Executed 4-agent parallel repair: formula corrections, Γ→finite-β transfer proof, Schauder finite-time flow fix, boundary-mode analytical proof.

- `docs/03-31/proof/BASIN-ESCAPE-ANALYSIS.md` — Proposition BMD (boundary-mode dominance) analytically proved via Hessian diagonal gap argument, core fraction O(1/β)
- `Canonical Spec v2.0.md` — 3 errata added (boundary-mode proof, Step 4 fix, Schauder finite-time flow, Thm 2 split)

### Files Created
- `experiments/exp25_hessian_diagonal.py` — Hessian diagonal verification for boundary-mode dominance

## 2026-04-01 — Status Refresh & Plan Realignment

### Summary
Consolidated the current mathematical state after the strong-regime / near-bifurcation documentation pass, verified what has actually been established, and rewrote `plan/Plan_0401.md` around the next real frontier: product-manifold basin theory, merge competitors, selection, and `exp24` integration.

### Files Created
None

### Files Modified
- `plan/Plan_0401.md` — Rewritten from a forward-looking placeholder into a status-aware live plan with completed items, current frontier, and prioritized next theorems

- Explicit `(K-1)` merge competitor branch construction
- Strong-regime selection theorem / branch-choice hypothesis

## 2026-03-31 — Strong-Regime Theorem Ladder & Near-Bifurcation Local Theory

### Summary
Executed the mathematical-priority part of `plan/Plan_0331.md` without touching code: formalized a theorem ladder for the strongly-interacting regime, unified the three multi-formation temporal regimes, and isolated near-bifurcation persistence as a shrinking-window local theory rather than a full persistence theorem.

### Files Created
- `docs/03-31/proof/T-PERSIST-K-STRONG-MORSE-ATTEMPT.md` — Strong-regime proof-attempt document with explicit theorem ladder: conditional coexistence theorem, local instability proposition, conditional merge proposition, full dichotomy left conjectural

- `docs/00-overview.md` — Updated top-level project-state header from stale I11/149-tests status to current I12/174-tests status

### Theorem Status Changes
- `T-Persist-K-Strong`: retained as **conjectured** at canonical level; clarified internally into a theorem ladder
- Strong-regime coexistence branch: sharpened to a **conditional local persistence theorem**
- Strong-regime merge branch: sharpened to a **conditional merge proposition** requiring explicit Morse/selection hypotheses
- Near-bifurcation persistence: sharpened to a **negative/local theory** — no uniform persistence theorem, only shrinking-window continuation and shifted-threshold survival

### Test Count
Last recorded: 174 tests passing (unchanged; no `scc/` code modified and no fresh re-run in this document-only session)

### Open Items Carried Forward
- Product-manifold basin/sublevel theorem on `Σ_M^K`
- Explicit construction of a nearby `(K-1)`-formation merge competitor branch
- Strong-regime transport/reoptimization selection theorem
- `exp24` completion and interpretation against the new near-bifurcation local theory
- Canonical Spec update only after a status-changing mathematical upgrade is justified by the new ladder

## 2026-03-31 — T-Persist-1 Gap 4/5/6 Strengthening (Session 2)

### Summary
Major advances on T-Persist-1 temporal persistence theorem: closed 3 of 4 remaining open conditions. Gap 6 (core depth) fully closed via isoperimetric proof. Gap 5 (transport concentration) upgraded: Schauder fixed-point existence proved, 3-component fingerprint tightened, boundary thinness shown to be definitional identity. Gap 4 (basin radius) corrected: r≥0.210 holds away from bifurcation but boundary-mode escape can be cheaper near shape transitions.

### Files Created

- `docs/03-31/INDEX.md` — Added proof/ section entries
- `CLAUDE.md` — Added run_all.py to experiment commands

### Theorem Status Changes
- T-Persist-1(d): H2 (hypothesis) → H2' (proved for |Core|≥25, β/α≫1)
- T-Persist-1(e): fixed-point existence: conditional → proved (Schauder)
- T-Persist-1(e): fingerprint: 4-component → 3-component (C(x,x) demoted)
- T-Persist-1(e): μ₀ threshold: 6.3 → 3.4 (tightened contraction constants)
- T-Persist-1(b): r≥0.210 universal → r≥0.210 away from bifurcation (corrected)
- T-Persist-Full: (WR) → (WR') relaxed; (H2) → (H2') proved

### Test Count
174 tests passing (unchanged — no scc/ code modified)

### Open Items Carried Forward
- Near-bifurcation persistence: μ→0 at shape transitions, basin radius→0, T-Persist-1(b) fails
- Strong-regime fixed-point selection/uniqueness (Schauder gives existence, not uniqueness beyond weak regime)
- Barrier scaling Δ_soft ~ 0.037·μ^0.32 — no clean theoretical explanation for the exponent
- exp24 (basin flow test) unfinished — would test whether gradient flow basin exceeds sublevel-set estimate
