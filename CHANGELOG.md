### Summary
Final verification phase. exp43: scale test up to 50×50 (n=2500) — all predictions hold; deep/core ratio 0.67→0.91, Bind stable at 0.85, boundary scaling slope -0.435. Formation birth theory formalized: three mechanisms (parametric nucleation, topological splitting, volume-driven — last not observed). Final spec audit: 43/43 theorems consistent; 1 medium issue (T-Bind section placement). CLAUDE.md stale r̄₀ reference updated.

## 2026-04-01 — Phase 6: Tight Confinement, Scale Verification, r̄₀ Bound

### Summary
Three theory tightening tasks. exp41: formation-aware confinement bounds tested — B_naive remains only universally valid bound (max ratio 0.48), B1 (boundary-proportional) nearly valid (1.02× violation). exp42: scale verification on 10-30×30 — all predictions hold at scale; boundary scaling slope = -0.499 (theory: -0.500); deep/core ratio increases from 0.68 to 0.89; transport converges in 1-3 iterations. r̄₀ bound: proved r̄₀ = O(n^{-1/d}) via KKT + sharp-interface analysis, upgrading T-Bind from Category B → A for τ=1/2.

### Files Created
- `experiments/exp41_tight_confinement.py` — Formation-aware confinement bounds (5 candidates)
- `experiments/exp42_scale_verification.py` — Scale verification 10-30×30

### Test Count
175 tests passing (unchanged)

## 2026-04-01 — Phase 5: Formation Birth, T-Persist Confinement Verification, Unified Synthesis

### Summary
Three final verification tasks. exp39: formation birth/split tested via volume increase, β decrease, and topological crack — K=1 always energetically preferred but crack (w≤0.2) causes natural 2-component splitting within single formation. exp40: transport confinement bound verified but too conservative (C_conf·√m >> r_basin by 30-100×, actual displacement only 0-4% of bound); all 6 configs pass persistence regardless. Unified synthesis document: 24 fully proved + 6 structural + 6 conditional + 2 retracted + 5 open = 36 total claims, 83% proved/conditional. Theory assessed as publication-ready.

### Files Created
- `experiments/exp39_formation_birth.py` — Formation birth/split (3 scenarios)
- `experiments/exp40_persist_confinement.py` — T-Persist confinement verification
- `docs/04-01/synthesis/UNIFIED-THEORY-STATUS.md` — Comprehensive 334-line synthesis

## 2026-04-01 — Phase 4: Bifurcation Crossing, Barrier Height, Isoperimetric Proof, Transport Bound

### Summary
Three parallel tasks close remaining theory gaps. exp37: bifurcation crossing at β_crit≈5 on 12×12 is a supercritical pitchfork (no hysteresis, two distinct branches at ±Fiedler direction). exp38: K-merge barrier height scales as O(β^0.89) — 106-466 energy units at β=20-100, confirming kinetic stability of multi-formation states. Theory: isoperimetric energy ordering proved (test function + discrete isoperimetric inequality in sharp-interface regime); transport confinement bound proved (C_conf = O(σ√(ε_OT log n)), independent of u_s).

### Files Created

- K-Merge Barrier: **Unquantified** → **O(β^0.89)** (exp38, 6 configs)
- Bifurcation type: **Unknown** → **Supercritical pitchfork** (exp37, no hysteresis)

### Test Count

- Formation birth (K → K+1) — reverse of merge
- Tight constants in transport confinement bound

---

## 2026-04-01 — Phase 3: Near-Bif Directional Extension + Boundary Dynamics + Universal Ordering

### Summary
Three parallel experiments verify and extend the near-bifurcation theory. exp34: directional basin is 2.5-4.3× larger than isotropic near bifurcation, extending Tier 1 persistence to smaller spectral gaps. exp35: K=1 preferred over K=2 in ALL 24 extreme topologies (barbell, weighted bridge, star) — isoperimetric ordering appears universal. exp36: boundary instability channel confirmed (shallow/deep Δu ratio up to 4.3×), no actual threshold crossings at any tested config. Directional Persistence Extension theorem proved.

### Files Created

- Near-bif Tier 1: **Extended** — covers 2.5-4.3× wider spectral gap range
- Universal Isoperimetric Ordering: **Conjectured** (verified on 24 topologies)

### Test Count
175 tests passing (unchanged)

### Open Items Carried Forward
- Bifurcation crossing (μ = 0) / branch selection — sole genuinely open T-Persist item

## 2026-04-01 — Phase 2: A1 Transport Selection + A2 Merge Dichotomy

### Summary
Two A-grade open problems resolved in parallel. A1 (strong-regime transport selection): exp29 λ_tr sweep [0.01, 10] on 10×10/15×15 grids finds **no transport multiplicity** — re-optimization acts as discrete attractor, making fixed point unique. WR' condition replaceable by weaker transport confinement. A2 (K-Strong merge dichotomy): exp30 falsifies saddle conjecture — K=2 is always a local minimum (Hessian curvature +1000–1500), K=1 is globally preferred (ΔE ≈ −7.6, 49% reduction). Merge requires barrier crossing, not saddle descent. Both findings strengthen T-Persist: selection uniqueness removes WR' dependency; local stability of K-formations ensures persistence without saddle avoidance.

### Files Created

- `experiments/exp29_results.json` — exp29 raw results

### Files Modified
- `Canonical Spec v2.0.md` — T-Persist-K-Strong: saddle → barrier model erratum; T-Persist-Full: strong-regime selection resolved erratum; bridging section updated
- `docs/04-01/INDEX.md` — Added theory/ section with 2 new documents

### Theorem Status Changes
- T-Persist-1(e) selection: **conditional on WR'** → **conditional on transport confinement** (weaker, numerically verified)
- T-Persist-K-Strong: **Conjectured (saddle model)** → **Partially proved (barrier model)** — local stability proved, isoperimetric ordering proved, saddle conjecture retracted
- K=2 Local Stability: **New** — proved (merge-direction curvature ≥ μ₁ + μ₂ > 0)
- Isoperimetric Energy Ordering: **New** — proved on homogeneous graphs

### Test Count
175 tests passing (unchanged)

### Open Items Carried Forward

## 2026-04-01 — Final Strengthening: Code Alignment, Full Chain Closure, Stress Test, Synthesis

### Summary
Code-theory alignment (3-component fingerprint in transport.py, 175 tests). exp27 warm-start chain: **5/5 parts × 5/5 configs = 100% pass** — proves exp26 failures were optimizer artifacts, not theory defects. exp28 stress test (100 combos): 84/100 pass, all failures from small-grid deep-core absence.

## 2026-03-31 — Strong-Regime Theorem Ladder & Near-Bifurcation Local Theory

### Summary
Executed the mathematical-priority part of `plan/Plan_0331.md` without touching code: formalized a theorem ladder for the strongly-interacting regime, unified the three multi-formation temporal regimes, and isolated near-bifurcation persistence as a shrinking-window local theory rather than a full persistence theorem.

### Files Created

- Strong-regime coexistence branch: sharpened to a **conditional local persistence theorem**
- Strong-regime merge branch: sharpened to a **conditional merge proposition** requiring explicit Morse/selection hypotheses
- Near-bifurcation persistence: sharpened to a **negative/local theory** — no uniform persistence theorem, only shrinking-window continuation and shifted-threshold survival

### Test Count
Last recorded: 174 tests passing (unchanged; no `scc/` code modified and no fresh re-run in this document-only session)

### Open Items Carried Forward
- Product-manifold basin/sublevel theorem on `Σ_M^K`
- Explicit construction of a nearby `(K-1)`-formation merge competitor branch

## 2026-03-31 — T-Persist-1 Gap 4/5/6 Strengthening (Session 2)

Gap 5 (transport concentration) upgraded: Schauder fixed-point existence proved, 3-component fingerprint tightened, boundary thinness shown to be definitional identity.

- Strong regime transport — open (Brouwer continuity gap)
- Near-bifurcation persistence — open
